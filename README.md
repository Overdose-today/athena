# Athena

## what is it?
Athena is a modified client for the [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) game, version 1.8.8. It is a fork of [Maven Minecraft Coder Pack](https://github.com/Hexeption/MavenMCP).

## why?
Athena client was a fairly good client, however it was closed source. Me (Shae) and Nikicia stopped working on it. I decided to continue it, but make it open source.
